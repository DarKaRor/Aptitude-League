# Aptitude-League
Aptitude League is a video game inspired by the idea of multiple intelligences described by Howard Gardner, they describe that we as human can develop a certain amount of intelligences that vary on type. There is:

 - Logical-Mathematical Intelligence
 - Naturalistic Intelligence
 - Musical Intelligence
 - Visual-Spatial Intelligence
 - Linguistic Intelligence
 - Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence
 - Interpersonal Intelligence
 - Intrapersonal Intelligence
 
 All of these intelligences are represented inside of the game in order to help the player develop them while having fun.
# How does it work?
Aptitude League has two different ways to be played **Arcade** and **Freeplay**, in the Arcade mode you have to face a random minigame each round, adding points to your score as long as you beat the minigame, if you happen to lose in one of the minigames the game is over and your score will be saved.

In Freeplay mode you're able to play the minigame you like the most so you can either practice or try to beat your record in this specific minigame.

The game contains at least 2 minigames per intelligence (Logical-Mathematical being the exception by having 3 minigames) and Intrapersonal not being a minigame but a time for self reflection each 5 minigames.
